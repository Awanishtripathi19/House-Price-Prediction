# House-Price-Prediction
Overview

The Boston House Price Dataset, also known as the "Boston Housing Dataset," is a widely-used dataset in the field of machine learning. It contains information about various factors that may influence the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston neighborhoods. This dataset is often used for regression analysis and predictive modeling.

The dataset consists of 506 data points, with 13 features each:
1 CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town.

2 ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots.

3 INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.

4 CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).

5 NOX: Nitrogen oxide concentration (parts per 10 million).

6RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling.

7 AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940.

8 DIS: Weighted distance to employment centers.

9 RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways.

10 TAX: Property tax rate.

11 PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio.

12 B: Proportion of residents of African American descent.

13 LSTAT: Percentage of lower status population.

The target variable, which we aim to predict, is the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV).
